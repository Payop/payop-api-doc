# IPN - Withdrawal

After the withdrawal has received the final status (Successful or Rejected), the payment gateway sends an Instant
Payment Notification (IPN) to the Merchantâ€™s server.

A notification is sent to the URL that you have specified in your account settings (**Settings -> Withdraw IPN URL**).

For greater security, we highly recommend that you accept IPN from our IP addresses only:

* 3.125.109.58
* 3.127.103.117
* 18.143.40.196 
* 54.179.10.165

----

**Note:** Sometimes an IPN that is related to a particular order may be sent multiple times. If you are receiving
multiple IPNs with the same status and data (`withdrawId`, `status` etc.) that refer to a withdrawal, **please make sure
the payment has been processed only once at your side**.

---
In this way, you need to check the following: if you received IPNs with the same status and data (withdraw ID, status
etc.) related to a transaction, you have to accept only the first notification and ignore the others.

However, several IPN notifications should be accepted for a particular transaction if they carry different statuses. In
this case, you don't need to ignore them, but update the current transaction state.

**For instance:**

**CASE 1**: You received several IPNs with the same data and "success" state for withdrawing ID 1111;

**CASE 2**: You received an IPN for withdrawing ID 1111 with the status 'failed'; later on you received the other IPN
notification with the same transaction data for the withdrawal ID 1111, but with the state "success".

**Solution:**

**CASE 1**: You only need to accept the first notification and ignore the others;

**CASE 2**: You shouldn't ignore notifications with a different state to let the transaction status become updated.

----

**Note:** Please note! A notification is sent to the merchant's server within 24 hours and until the PayOp server, upon
this request, receives the HTTP status code `200 OK`.
