# Integration API types:
## [1. Hosted Page](hostedPage.md)
This type of integration is available to everyone by default, this is the most preferable and easiest way. The checkout page is currently available in English and Russian.

The methods on the page in the upper block are displayed in accordance with the localization set in the browser being used. And for this country, payment methods are selected that are available for the country and available to the merchant.

Methods are displayed in accordance with the payer's IP in the lower block.

<!--The checkout page can be customized: admin panel `Payop -> Customize`. After customization, the panel asks for confirmation from the Payop team.--> 

Also it is possible to skip the checkout and integrate each method independently by passing the Method ID in the request. This will redirect the user directly to the payment data entry page using a specific method. When the payer clicks on the eWallet payment method, they will be redirected to a page where they can enter their eWallet account details to authorize the payment.

### Features of this type of integration:

* no need to create your own checkout page
* checkout occurs on the Payop page (there is a redirect from your domain name to payop.com)
* it will not be possible to immediately transfer the payer's details in order to minimize the payment path
<!--* you donâ€™t need to implement data processing for redirecting to the 3DS page - you can customize the standard checkout page-->
<!--* no need to obtain a special certificate to be able to make payments (PCI DSS lvl 1 or 2 (AOC form) compliance)-->

## [2. Direct integration](../Integration/direct.md)

This type of integration is more suitable for businesses experienced in development.

Using this type of integration it is possible to skip the initial Payop checkout page and integrate each method independently by passing the Method ID in the request. This will redirect the payer directly to the payment data entry page for a specific method. Therefore, by using this integration type, you can use several payment methods on your own checkout page and redirect the payer directly to the page to enter the payment data.

Features of this type of integration:



* _you can create your own checkout page and customize it according to your needs_
* _no need to obtain a special certificate to be able to make payments (PCI DSS LVL 1 or 2 (AOC form) compliance)_
* _you can minimize the amount of actions needed to be done by client in order to complete the payment_
* _you will need to add more details to your request when making payments (as compared with hosted page)_

<!--## [2. Server-to-server (S2S) integration](serverToServer.md)

This is a direct integration, in which the checkout page and data entry for the PM is made by the merchant himself, using any of his designs and logos, and not our developments.

To access this type of integration, the merchant must provide a document on PCI DSS lvl 1 or 2 (AOC form) compliance.
The merchant on his side processes and stores the necessary data for payment.
A special token is generated for card methods.

<em> 

### Features of this type of integration:

* you can immediately transfer the payer's card data from your side for card methods (if you collect or store) in order to minimize the payment path
* payment takes place on your side, without redirecting the payer to a third-party domain
* displaying the checkout page in the language you need
* you will need to use more requests when making payments (to create a card token and checkout transactions) for card methods in the integration settings
* it is mandatory to obtain a PCI DSS lvl 1 or 2 (AOC form) compliance certificate for card methods
