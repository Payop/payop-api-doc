## Transaction states

Status | Type     | Description                       |
-------|----------|-----------------------------------|
1      | new      | New transaction, no actions were taken                   |
2      | accepted | Transaction was paid successfully |
4      | pending  | Transaction pending, has not yet been paid and is expected to be paid               |
3, 5, 15 | failed   | Transaction failed, has not been paid for technical or financial reasons                |
9     | pre-approved|Transaction has been submitted through the bank, however, we are still awaiting the funds to be credited to our account.*              |

> **Important!** *"Pre-approved" status may change to "Accepted" status or "Failed" status, in case funds are not received or the payer has canceled the transaction. While it is quite a rare scenario, in some cases it is still possible to cancel the payment on the payer's side, **please use "Pre-approved" for goods/service delivery at your own risk. Only the final "Accepted" status is guaranteed**
