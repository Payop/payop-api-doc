### **Bearer Authentication**


#### **Purpose:**

* **This section explains how authentication works in the Payop API using JWT-based Bearer Authentication.**
* **Authentication is required for accessing protected API endpoints.**

#### **How It Works:**

* **Clients must send a JWT token in the <code>Authorization</code> header with each API request.**

![HEADERS](https://img.shields.io/badge/-headers-purple?style=for-the-badge)

```
Content-Type: application/json  
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

* <strong>Tokens can be generated in the Payop dashboard and should be securely stored.</strong>

> **Deprecated: Using tokens in the header directly is discouraged, and this method may be removed in future API versions.**

### **Transaction states**

Status | Type         | Description                                                                                                              |
-------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
1      | new          | New transaction, no actions were taken                                                                                   |
2      | accepted     | Transaction was paid successfully                                                                                        |
4      | pending      | Transaction pending, has not yet been paid and is expected to be paid                                                    |
3, 5  | failed       | Transaction failed, has not been paid for technical or financial reasons                                                 |
9     | pre-approved | Transaction has been submitted through the bank, however, we are still awaiting the funds to be credited to our account* |
15    | timeout      | Transaction timed out due to lack of final confirmation from the payer after initiation                                  |

> **üßæPlease Note:** *"Pre-approved" status may change to "Accepted" status or "Failed" status, in case funds are not received or the payer has canceled the transaction. While it is quite a rare scenario, in some cases it is still possible to cancel the payment on the payer's side, **please use "Pre-approved" for goods/service delivery at your own risk. Only the final "Accepted" status is guaranteed**

### **4. IPN**


#### **Purpose:**

* **Describes how Instant Payment Notification (IPN) works.**
* **IPNs inform merchants in real-time about payment updates.**


#### **How It Works:**

* **Once a transaction is completed, Payop sends an IPN request to the merchant‚Äôs pre-configured IPN URL.**
* **Merchants should validate the IPN and update their order statuses accordingly.**
* **IPNs may be sent multiple times until a confirmation (HTTP 200) is received.**


#### **Endpoint:**

**IPN Request Format:**


```json
{
 "invoice": {
   "id": "invoice_id",
   "status": 1,
   "txid": "transaction_id"

 },

 "transaction": {
   "id": "transaction_id",
   "state": 2,
   "order": { "id": "ORDER_ID" },
   "error": {
     "message": "Error message",
     "code": ""
   }
 }
}
```



#### **Handling IPNs:**



* **Validate the IPN request source (only accept from Payop IPs).**
* **Ensure transactions are updated based on received status.**
* **Prevent duplicate processing if the same IPN is received multiple times.**


---


### **5. Void Transaction**


#### **Purpose:**

* **Cancels (voids) a transaction  in status ‚ÄúPending‚Äù.**
* **Used when the merchant wants to cancel an ongoing transaction and initiate a new one with a fresh invoice**

#### **How It Works:**


* **A <code>POST</code> request is sent with the invoice identifier.**
* **The response confirms whether the void was successful.**

#### **Endpoint:**

![POST](https://img.shields.io/badge/-POST-yellow?style=for-the-badge)

```shell
https://api.payop.com/v1/checkout/void
```


**Key Parameter:**



* **<code>invoiceIdentifier</code>: The unique invoice ID.**


![response](https://img.shields.io/badge/success-response-green?style=for-the-badge)

```json
{
 "data": {
   "isSuccess": true,
   "message": "",
   "txid": "canceled_transaction_id"
 },
 "status": 1
}
```
