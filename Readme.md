# Payop REST-like API Reference

Payop API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer).

Payop API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [JSON](http://www.json.org/) request bodies,
returns [JSON](http://www.json.org/) responses and uses standard HTTPS response codes.

Each request to Payop API should have a `Content-Type` HTTPS header with `application/json` value.

## Payop integration options
   * [Hosted page](https://github.com/Payop/payop-api-doc/blob/master/Integration/hostedPage.md) – a very simple integration option using default Payop checkout pages
   * [Direct integration](https://github.com/Payop/payop-api-doc/blob/master/Integration/direct.md) – bypassing the Payop hosted page
 <!--  * [Server-To-Server](https://github.com/Payop/payop-api-doc/blob/master/Integration/serverToServer.md) – integration using Payop API for users having a PCI DSS certificate -->
   * Pre-setup integration plugins
      * [Woocommerce](https://github.com/Payop/woocommerce-plugin)

You can learn more about the difference between the above options here: [Difference description](https://github.com/Payop/payop-api-doc/blob/master/Integration/difference.md).
