# Integration API Types

Payop offers two primary integration options for merchants to process payments: **Hosted Page Integration** and **Direct Integration**. Each method has its own benefits, depending on your business needs, technical capabilities, and the level of control you want over the payment process.

## **1. Hosted Page Integration**


### **Overview**

The **Hosted Page Integration** is the **simplest** and **most convenient** method for merchants who prefer a **quick and easy** way to accept payments without extensive development efforts. Payop handles most of the payment flow, including security, compliance, and user experience.


### **How It Works**

**🔹1. Create an Invoice** – A request is sent to generate a payment invoice. `POST https://api.payop.com/v1/invoices/create`  
*( [See the Invoice section for more details](../1.Invoice/invoice.md) )*  
**🔹2. Redirect the Payer** – The payer is redirected to the **invoice preprocessing page**. (`https://checkout.payop.com/{{locale}}/payment/invoice-preprocessing/{{invoiceId}}`)  
**🔹3. Payer Enters Required Data:** On the Payop checkout page, the payer fills in necessary details (e.g., name, date of birth, email, etc.).  
**🔹4. Automatic Processing** – Payop determines the next steps, such as selecting the appropriate payment method or requiring additional details.  
**🔹5. Payment Confirmation** – If the payment is successful, the payer is redirected to the `resultUrl`. If the payment fails, the payer is redirected to the `failPath`.  
**🔹6. Receive IPN (Instant Payment Notification)** If IPNs are configured, Payop will automatically notify your server when the transaction status changes. This ensures your backend is updated even if the user does not return to your site.   \

 *[See Checkout->IPN for more details](../2.Checkout/checkout.md#4-ipn)*


### **Checkout Flow**

1. **Create Invoice** `POST https://api.payop.com/v1/invoices/create`   
*( [See the Invoice section for more details](../1.Invoice/invoice.md) )*
2. **Redirect payer to invoice preprocessing page:**
3. `https://checkout.payop.com/{{locale}}/payment/invoice-preprocessing/{{invoiceId}}`
    * `{{locale}}` → Language of the invoice (`en`, `ru`, etc.).
    * `{{invoiceId}}` → Unique invoice identifier.
4. If all required fields are correctly filled, the system attempts to process the payment.
5. If required fields are missing, the payer is redirected to **checkout form completion**.
6. If additional authentication is needed the payer is redirected to the appropriate forms.
7. **Redirection:**
    * On **successful payment**, the payer is redirected to the `resultUrl` specified when creating the invoice.
    * On **failed payment**, the payer is redirected to `failPath`.

### **Advantages of Hosted Page Integration**

✅ **Quick Setup:** No development expertise required.  
✅ **Minimal Effort:** Payop handles the checkout process, reducing merchant workload.  
✅ **Secure and Compliant:** Payment processing fully complies with industry regulations and security standards without requiring additional efforts from merchants.  
✅ **Global Payment Methods:** The payer sees only available methods based on their country and IP.  


### **Best Use Cases**



* Businesses that want **a fast and hassle-free** integration.
* Merchants who **do not want to build** their own checkout page.
* Companies needing **multi-language** and **multi-currency** payment solutions with minimal setup.


## **2. Direct Integration**

The Direct Integration option provides a more advanced and customizable way for merchants to accept payments by bypassing the Payop-hosted checkout page. Instead, merchants integrate specific payment methods directly into their own system, giving them full control over the user experience, design, and data collection flow.

This method is ideal for businesses with development resources who want to embed payments directly into their own UI and reduce friction during the checkout process.


### **How It Works**

**🔹1. Retrieve Available Payment Methods**

Use your application ID to retrieve a list of available payment methods via the API:

```shell
curl -X GET "https://api.payop.com/v1/instrument-settings/payment-methods/available-for-application/{APPLICATION_ID}" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

The response includes method identifiers and the required payer fields for each method. 


![response](https://img.shields.io/badge/success-response-green?style=for-the-badge)

```json
{
 "data": [
   {
     "identifier": 203822,
     "type": "bank_transfer",
     "title": "Pay by bank",
     "currencies": ["EUR", "GBP"],
     "countries": ["AT", "ES", "IT", "PT", "FR", "DE", "FI", "NL", "EE", "LT"],
     "config": {
       "fields": [
         { "name": "email", "type": "email", "required": true },
         { "name": "name", "type": "text", "required": true },
         { "name": "date_of_birth", "type": "text", "required": true }       ]
     }
   }
 ]
}


```


**🔹2. Collect Payer Data**

Based on the selected payment method, collect the required fields from the payer. For example:
  * `email`
  * `name`
  * `date_of_birth`

>⚠️**Important**: For payment methods that include the fields `bank_code`, `bank_type`, and `bank_country`, visiting the Payop checkout page is mandatory. On the checkout page, the payer must select the bank through which the payment will be processed.
>Therefore, these fields should generally not be passed directly from the merchant’s side, as they must reflect the payer’s own bank selection on checkout.
>Considering the information above, in this case, bypassing the checkout page is not possible.

**🔹3. Create Invoice** 

Use your public key and signature to create an invoice:
*You can generate a signature using the script ( [See signature generation instruction section for more details](signatureGenerator.md) )*

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.payop.com/v1/invoices/create" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "publicKey": "application-xxx",
    "order": {
      "id": "12345",
      "amount": "3",
      "currency": "EUR",
      "description": "Test payment",
      "items": []
    },
    "signature": "GENERATED_SIGNATURE",
    "payer": {
      "email": "test.user@payop.com"
    },
    "language": "en",
    "resultUrl": "https://your.site/result",
    "failPath": "https://your.site/fail"
  }'

```
![response](https://img.shields.io/badge/success-response-green?style=for-the-badge)

```json
{
    "data": "invoice_unique_id",
    "status": 1
}
```


**🔹4. Create Checkout Transaction** 

Once required data is collected and the invoice is created, initiate the transaction with a POST request:


```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.payop.com/v1/checkout/create" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{
   "invoiceIdentifier": "YOUR_INVOICE_ID",
   "customer": {
     "email": "test.user@payop.com",
     "name": "John Doe",
     "ip": "192.168.1.1",
     "extraFields": {
       "date_of_birth": "01.01.1990"
     }
   },
   "paymentMethod": 203822,
   "checkStatusUrl": "https://your.site/check-status/{{txid}}"
 }'

```

![POST](https://img.shields.io/badge/request-post-yellow?style=for-the-badge)


```json
{
 "invoiceIdentifier": "YOUR_INVOICE_ID",
 "customer": {
   "email": "test.user@payop.com",
   "name": "John Doe",
   "ip": "192.168.1.1",
   "extraFields": {
     "date_of_birth": "01.01.1990"   
}
 },
 "paymentMethod": 203822,
 "checkStatusUrl": "https://your.site/check-status/{{txid}}"
}

```


![response](https://img.shields.io/badge/success-response-green?style=for-the-badge)

```json
{
 "data": {
   "isSuccess": true,
   "message": "",
   "txid": "transaction_unique_id"
 },
 "status": 1
}

```

>**🧾Please Note:**
>When using a custom Waiting Page, you only need to redirect the user to it once — after calling /v1/checkout/create. 
>All subsequent redirects to the custom Waiting Page (after the bank page, 3ds, etc.) will be processed automatically by the system, i.e., the payer will be returned to the Waiting Page automatically.


**🔹5. Check Invoice Status (Polling)**  

Use this endpoint to determine when to move forward in the flow. This does not reflect the transaction result but simply indicates that a redirect to the payment provider page is available.

```shell
curl -X GET "https://api.payop.com/v1/checkout/check-invoice-status/{invoiceID}" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
```

![possible response](https://img.shields.io/badge/possible-response-blue?style=for-the-badge)


```json
{
 "data": {
   "isSuccess": true,
   "status": "success",
   "form": {
     "method": "GET",
     "url": "https://checkout.payop.com/en/payment/success-page/",
     "fields": []
   },
   "url": "https://checkout.payop.com/en/payment/success-page/"
 },
 "status": 1
}

```

![possible response](https://img.shields.io/badge/possible-response-blue?style=for-the-badge)

```json
{
"data": {
  "isSuccess": true,
  "status": "pending",
  "form": {
    "method": "GET",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "fields": []
  },
  "url": "https://example.com"
},
"status": 1
}


```

**Status-Based Actions**


* **If** `status = success` → Redirect the user to the URL provided in `data.form.url` (e.g., the success page).
* **If** `status = fail` → Redirect the user to the URL provided in `data.form.url`, which will lead to the fail page.
* **If** `status = pending`→ Redirect the user to the URL in `data.form.url`,  which points either to the payment provider's page or to the Payop checkout page, where the payer can fill in the missing or invalid fields. 

Use the `method` and `fields` returned in the `data.form` object to construct a form and submit it from the browser. After the user completes the payment on the provider's side, they will be redirected back to either the success or fail page based on the final result.

**🔹6. Receive IPN (Instant Payment Notification)** 

If IPNs are configured, Payop will automatically notify your server when the transaction status changes to final. This ensures your backend is updated even if the user does not return to your site. \

*[Refer to Checkout->IPN section for more details](../2.Checkout/checkout.md#4-ipn)*

### **Checkout Flow Summary**

  1. **Call the payment methods list endpoint** to get available methods with the required payer fields.
  2. **Collect payer data** depending on the selected method.
  3. **Create an invoice** using the `/invoices/create` endpoint.
  4. **Create a transaction** using the `/checkout/create` endpoint.
  5. **Poll** `/checkout/check-invoice-status/{invoiceID}` and consider redirecting the user based on status:
      * `success` → Success page
      * `fail`         → Fail page
      * `pending` → Payment provider page → then redirected to final status page
  6. Listen for [IPN](../2.Checkout/checkout.md#4-ipn) callbacks to confirm final transaction status.

### **Simplified Checkout Flow Summary**

This is a simplified direct integration flow designed to minimize the effort required from your side. You don’t need to create a checkout transaction, implement status polling, or manually handle redirects. All you need to do is create an invoice with a predefined payment method and payer data, and redirect the payer to the invoice preprocessing page. From that point onward, the Payop system automatically manages the rest, including transaction creation and redirecting the user to the appropriate pages. You can still embed payments directly into your UI. However, this flow will be much more similar to the Hosted Page integration (Payop-hosted pages won’t be bypassed).

  1. **Call the payment methods list endpoint** to get available methods with the required payer fields.
  2. **Collect payer data** depending on the selected method.
  3. **Fill in the required payer fields**, indicate the selected method in the paymentMethod field, and create an invoice using the /invoices/create endpoint.
  4. **Redirect the payer** to the invoice preprocessing page: `https://checkout.payop.com/{{locale}}/payment/invoice-preprocessing/{{invoiceId}}`
     * `{{locale}}` → Language of the invoice (e.g., en, ru, etc.).
     * `{{invoiceId}}` → Unique invoice identifier.
  5. **Flow logic**:
     * If **all required fields** are **filled correctly**, the system attempts to process the payment.
     * If **some required fields** are **missing**, the payer is redirected to the checkout form for completion.
     * If **additional authentication** is **needed**, the payer is redirected to the relevant authentication form.
  6. **Redirection** will be handled depending on whether the payment is successful or failed, and the payer will be sent to the appropriate `resultUrl` or `failPath` specified upon the invoice creation. 
  7. **Receive [IPN](../2.Checkout/checkout.md#4-ipn)** (Instant Payment Notification). Payop automatically sends a notification to your configured URL whenever the transaction status changes to final. This allows your backend to stay updated with the final payment result.

### **Advantages of Direct Integration**

✅ **Optimized User Flow**  
By embedding required fields and handling logic on the merchant’s side, the number of steps for the payer is reduced—resulting in a smoother, more streamlined experience.

✅ **Faster Checkout Process**  
No need to navigate through intermediate Payop-hosted method selection pages. The payer is taken directly to the payment form, speeding up the process.

✅ **Ideal for Complex Checkout Use Cases**
Perfect for platforms and systems that require tighter integration or more advanced UX control, such as e-commerce platforms, SaaS tools, or mobile apps.

---
### **Best Use Cases**



* Businesses that **already have** a own custom checkout system.
* Merchants who need **control** over the payment process.
* Companies looking to **minimize the payment steps** for a seamless user experience.
