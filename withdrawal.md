# Withdrawal

**Important!** To create a withdrawal request, you must first [receive a token for your user](authentication.md),
 as described in the [login section](authentication.md) and create a certificate to encrypt request payload.
 1. When creating a request for withdrawal, you must transfer a personal token in the header of the http request.
 2. When creating a request for withdrawal, you must encrypt request payload with a personal certificate.
  You can **download** your personal certificate in [your account](https://payop.com/en/profile/settings/certificate).

#### Withdrawal flow

**Important!** Withdrawal is asynchronous operation. That is means that you never get final status on withdrawal create action.

 1. [Create withdrawal request](#mass-batch-withdrawal-requests)
 2. Save withdrawal id from response (`id` property from response object related to concrete withdrawal)
 3. [Check withdrawal status by getting withdrawal details](#get-concrete-withdrawal-details)
  every 10 minutes (available statuses: 1 - Pending; 2 - Accepted; 3 - Rejected).

----
**Note:** Your application have to change withdrawal status on your side only in case you get final status from Payop (2 or 3). 
As example, if you are getting 500 http error code (or something like this) when you make request to get withdrawal details,
you don't need to change withdrawal status. Just leave it as pending and repeat request later.

#### Request payload encrypt/decrypt

We are using popular encryption library to decrypt request payload - [Sodium](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/).
In short, before send withdrawal request you have to make next steps:
 
* Encrypt request payload with [Sodium Sealed boxes](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/sealed_boxes#usage)
(
    [Python](https://libnacl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/raw_sealed.html),
    [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.sodium-crypto-box-seal.php)
)
* Encode encrypted binary string with Base64
 
Below you can see PHP example, how encrypt request payload before send withdrawal request:

```php
$certificate = file_get_contents('path_to_certificate');
$data = [
    [
            'method' => 8,
            'type' => 1,
            'amount' => 34,
            'currency' => 'USD',
            'additionalData' => [
                'direction' => 'direction one',
                'email' => 'my.email@address.com'
            ]
    ]
];

$encryptedPayload = sodium_crypto_box_seal(json_encode($data), $certificate);
// $encryptedPayload - it's a binary string
$base64Payload = base64_encode($encryptedPayload);
// $base64Payload - looks like a next string 9kQ7v9nXLHjeOyIqi+hIJfEKuOCQZ2C5WWVcnmfPHUxh1EbK5g=
